- cd to folder where "Spot Analysis" is
-run this in terminal/cmd: python create_env.py myenv requirements.txt
-run: python "Spot Alignment.py"

*** important note ***
- If you decide to run the create_env.py with the requirements.txt, then make sure you remove 
the myenv folder that pops up before committing to master. 

(If you already have the necessary modules imported, should be able to run the script as is)
